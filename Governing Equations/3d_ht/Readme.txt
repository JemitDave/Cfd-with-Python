#3 Dimensional Heat Conduction equation with no internal heat generation
  is solved using Jacobi's method
# The total length of the cube is 30 mm and a mesh of 1 mm is used
  i.e. dx=dy=dz=1(mm)
       m=n=o=31 (total points)
#Boundary Conditions:
	left wall=500K
	Right Wall=1000k
	Rest all walls:insulated boundary condition
#an error of 1e-3 is used as exit condition
